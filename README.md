# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Havent been working on my programming as much as I should have been so built a simple RPS program just to get myself back into the swing of things
This program is only runnable in the code editor, I have not built an app out of it just made it work properly in the terminal.

I struggled with the most played statistic but other than that this warm-up project was a breeze.
