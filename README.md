# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Havent been working on my programming as much as I should have been so built a simple RPS program just to get myself back into the swing of things.

**This program is only runnable in the terminal**

This program uses the random module with a list of valid options for the computer to play Rock Paper Scissors against human input.
It tracks: Total games played, games won, games lost, draws and your most used option.

I struggled with the most played statistic but other than that this warm-up project was a breeze.
